        <div id="contents" class="block">
            <ul>
                <li class="pages">The morning will be spent indoors so it will be like a regular office day, nothing special to prepare </li>
                <li class="pages">Afterwards we will go out for lunch so perhaps wear something with a loose waist band so you can eat a lot (just kidding... not really ;)</li>
                <li class="pages">Finally we will do some bouldering (indoor rock climbing) so bring some comfy loose clothes you can change into (tshirt and leggings/shorts/comfy pants)</li>
                <li class="pages">Bouldering is a messy activity with powder everywhere so don't bring a very nice tshirt, the ratty one with holes from the back of your closet will be the most ideal!</li>
                <li class="pages">Footwear: We will rent climbing shoes on the spot so you don't need to bring anything in particular</li>
                <li class="pages">The location of lunch and afternoon activities is <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/WVWWi4jMKhvaNTKS7"><u>Arkose Massy (click here for a map)</u></a>. We will drive there at 12 noon and stay there till the end of the scheduled activities. We are not organising transport back from Arkose in the evening, you can take public transport (Gare Massy-Palaiseau RER B and C) or hitch a ride with another SHINEdoc. </li>
