        <div id="contents" class="block">
            <ul>
                <li class="pages">The morning will be spent indoors so it will be like a regular office day, nothing special to prepare </li>
                <li class="pages">Afterwards we will go out for lunch so perhaps wear something with a loose waist band so you can eat a lot (just kidding... not really ;)</li>
                <li class="pages">Finally we will do some bouldering (indoor rock climbing) so bring some comfy loose clothes you can change into (tshirt and leggings/shorts/comfy pants)</li>
                <li class="pages">bouldering is a messy activity with powder everywhere so don't bring a very nice tshirt, the ratty one with holes from the back of your closet will be the most ideal!</li>
                <li class="pages">Footwear: We will rent climbing shoes on the spot so you don't need to bring anything in particular</li>
            </ul>
